Resources and documentation for using Elastic for Information Retrieval

Elasticsearch (ES) is written in Java and builds on the top of Lucene. It provides a REST API to the Lucene library and uses JSON as data format. It is part of the Elastic Stack (ELK+), along with Logstash and Kibana. Logstash enables to get data into Elasticsearch (among other functionalities): it is a data processing pipeline that can ingest, transform and filter data before sending data to a stash (typically Elasticsearch). Kibana is an analytics and visualisation platform that lets you analyse data stored in ES; it has pre-coded diagrams and plots, that can be expanded. The Elastic Stack (ELK+) has further more products, like Beats and Xpack. Beats lets you get hold of the data to pass to Logstash or to ES: for example there are Beats for collecting network traffic, system performance, etc. Xpack contains extensions for ES, e.g. security (including LDAP integrations), alerting, monitoring, reporting.
